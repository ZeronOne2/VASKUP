# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement File Upload System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a Streamlit interface for uploading Excel files containing patent numbers.
# Details:
1. Use Streamlit's file_uploader widget to accept .xlsx, .xls, and .csv files
2. Implement file validation to ensure only allowed formats are uploaded
3. Use pandas to read the uploaded file
4. Create a function to automatically detect the patent number column
5. Allow users to manually select the patent number column if auto-detection fails
6. Display a preview of the uploaded data using st.dataframe()
7. Implement error handling for file reading and processing

# Test Strategy:
1. Test uploading files of each allowed format
2. Verify that invalid file formats are rejected
3. Check that the patent number column is correctly identified in various file layouts
4. Ensure the data preview displays correctly
5. Test error handling with corrupted or invalid files
