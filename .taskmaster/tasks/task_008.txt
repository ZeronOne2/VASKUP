# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Batch Processing for Multiple Patents
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a basic MVP system to process and analyze multiple patents in batch.
# Details:
1. Create a new module 'batch_processor.py' in the src/ directory
2. Implement a function to read and validate multiple patent numbers from the uploaded Excel file
3. Create a simple sequential batch processing system
4. Implement basic error handling and logging for batch operations
5. Develop a simple progress tracking system to monitor batch processing status
6. Implement a results aggregation function to combine processed patent data

# Test Strategy:
1. Test batch processing with a small number of patents
2. Verify correct handling of API rate limits during batch processing
3. Test the basic progress tracking system for accuracy
4. Verify error handling and logging for common failure scenarios
