# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Caching and Performance Optimization
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 7, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop caching mechanisms and optimize performance across the entire system.
# Details:
1. Implement a caching system for SerpAPI results to reduce API calls
2. Create a local cache for scraped patent descriptions
3. Optimize vector store operations for faster retrieval
4. Implement query result caching in the RAG system
5. Optimize batch processing with improved parallelization
6. Implement lazy loading for large datasets in the UI
7. Profile the application and identify performance bottlenecks
8. Optimize memory usage, especially for large patent datasets

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark system performance before and after optimizations
2. Verify cache hit rates for various operations
3. Test system behavior with large datasets (e.g., 1000+ patents)
4. Monitor memory usage during extended operation
5. Verify that optimizations don't impact result accuracy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze current system performance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct a thorough analysis of the current system performance to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
### Details:
Use profiling tools to measure response times, resource utilization, and identify performance bottlenecks across all system components.

## 2. Design caching strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop a comprehensive caching strategy for different system components based on the performance analysis.
### Details:
Determine appropriate caching mechanisms (e.g., in-memory, distributed, CDN) for each component and define cache invalidation policies.

## 3. Implement database query caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Implement caching for frequently executed database queries to reduce database load and improve response times.
### Details:
Use query result caching techniques, such as materialized views or in-memory caching solutions like Redis, to store and retrieve frequently accessed data.

## 4. Implement application-level caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Implement caching mechanisms within the application code to store and reuse computed results.
### Details:
Use in-memory caching libraries or distributed caching solutions to store method results, API responses, or rendered page fragments.

## 5. Set up Content Delivery Network (CDN) [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Implement a CDN to cache and serve static assets closer to end-users, reducing latency and server load.
### Details:
Choose a CDN provider, configure origin servers, and update asset URLs to use CDN-hosted versions for improved global content delivery.

## 6. Optimize front-end performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.5
### Description: Implement front-end optimizations to improve page load times and user experience.
### Details:
Minify and compress assets, implement lazy loading, use browser caching, and optimize critical rendering path for faster initial page loads.

## 7. Implement cache monitoring and analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3, 14.4, 14.5
### Description: Set up monitoring and analytics for cache performance to ensure effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
### Details:
Implement cache hit/miss ratio tracking, cache size monitoring, and performance impact analysis tools to continuously optimize caching strategies.

## 8. Develop cache management tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3, 14.4, 14.5
### Description: Create tools for managing and maintaining caches across different system components.
### Details:
Develop utilities for manual cache invalidation, cache warming, and cache consistency checks to ensure data integrity and optimal performance.

## 9. Conduct performance testing and optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.7, 14.8
### Description: Perform comprehensive performance testing and fine-tune caching mechanisms based on real-world usage patterns.
### Details:
Conduct load testing, stress testing, and real-user monitoring to validate caching effectiveness and make data-driven optimizations to the overall caching strategy.
