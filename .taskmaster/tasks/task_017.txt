# Task ID: 17
# Title: Develop API for External Integration
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 10, 12, 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Create an API to allow external systems to interact with the patent analysis system.
# Details:
1. Design RESTful API endpoints for key functionalities
2. Implement API using FastAPI framework
3. Create authentication and authorization for API access
4. Develop endpoints for submitting analysis jobs
5. Implement status checking and result retrieval endpoints
6. Create documentation for the API (e.g., using Swagger UI)
7. Implement rate limiting and usage monitoring
8. Develop sample client code for API usage

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each API endpoint for correct functionality
2. Verify authentication and authorization mechanisms
3. Test concurrent API requests and system load handling
4. Verify rate limiting and usage monitoring accuracy
5. Test API with sample client code in various languages
