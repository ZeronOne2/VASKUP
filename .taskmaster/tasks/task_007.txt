# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Basic RAG Pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for answering patent-related queries.
# Details:
1. Create a new module 'rag_pipeline.py' in the src/agentic_rag/ directory
2. Implement a function to process user queries and generate search vectors
3. Create a retrieval function that uses the vector store to find relevant patent chunks
4. Implement a basic prompt template for the language model, incorporating retrieved chunks
5. Set up integration with a language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo) for answer generation
6. Create a function to post-process and format the generated answers
7. Implement basic error handling and logging for the RAG pipeline
8. Add a caching mechanism to store recent query results

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each component of the RAG pipeline
2. Verify relevance of retrieved chunks for sample queries
3. Test answer generation with various types of patent-related questions
4. Benchmark end-to-end performance of the RAG pipeline
5. Verify error handling and logging functionality

## 7. Implement result ranking and filtering [done]
### Dependencies: 7.6
### Description: Create a module to rank and filter generated answers
### Details:
Develop algorithms to score and rank multiple generated answers, and filter out low-quality or irrelevant responses

## 8. Design and implement API endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 7.6, 7.7
### Description: Create API endpoints for the RAG pipeline
### Details:
Develop RESTful API endpoints to handle user queries and return generated answers
