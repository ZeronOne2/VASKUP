# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Vector Store Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up and integrate a vector database (Chroma) for storing and retrieving patent data embeddings.
# Details:
1. Create a new module 'vector_store.py' in the src/vector_store/ directory
2. Initialize Chroma vector store with appropriate settings
3. Implement functions to generate embeddings for patent chunks (use OpenAI or HuggingFace models)
4. Create functions to add patent data to the vector store, including metadata
5. Implement efficient batch processing for adding multiple patents
6. Create search functions to retrieve relevant patent chunks based on queries
7. Implement persistence for the vector store to save and load embeddings
8. Add logging and error handling for vector store operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test embedding generation and consistency
2. Verify correct storage and retrieval of patent chunks with metadata
3. Benchmark performance of batch processing and search operations
4. Test persistence by saving and loading the vector store
5. Verify error handling with various edge cases (e.g., duplicate entries, invalid data)

### Dependencies: 6.5, 6.6, 6.7
### Description: Develop full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the vector store
### Details:
Create methods for updating existing entries, deleting vectors, and maintaining consistency between the vector store and persistence layer
