# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Web Scraping for Patent Descriptions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a module to scrape and process detailed patent descriptions from the links provided by SerpAPI.
# Details:
1. Create a new module 'description_scraper.py' in the src/patent_search/ directory
2. Implement a function to scrape the description page using requests and BeautifulSoup
3. Extract the English translation of the description, removing original text in <span class="google-src-text">
4. Implement error handling for network issues and parsing errors
5. Create a function to clean and preprocess the scraped text
6. Implement multithreading to handle multiple description scraping tasks concurrently
7. Add logging to track scraping progress and any issues encountered

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the scraping function with sample HTML content
2. Test error handling with various network and parsing scenarios
3. Verify correct extraction of English translations
4. Benchmark scraping performance, especially with multithreading
5. Test with a variety of patent description pages to ensure robustness
