# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Advanced Agentic RAG System
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an advanced RAG system using LangGraph for intelligent patent analysis.
# Details:
1. Create a new directory src/agentic_rag/agents/ for individual agent modules
2. Implement the following agent modules:
   - query_analyzer.py: Analyze and classify user questions
   - planner.py: Develop answer strategies
   - query_generator.py: Generate optimal search queries
   - retriever.py: Perform multi-step retrieval
   - synthesizer.py: Synthesize information and generate answers
   - validator.py: Validate answer quality
3. Create a main workflow file 'rag_graph.py' using LangGraph
4. Implement state management for the RAG process
5. Develop conditional routing logic for adaptive processing
6. Implement logging and monitoring for the entire workflow
7. Create a mechanism to explain the reasoning process

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each agent module independently
2. Verify correct state management across the workflow
3. Test conditional routing with various question types
4. Benchmark performance and quality improvements over the basic RAG
5. Verify the explainability of the reasoning process

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define agent types and roles [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and define the different types of agents needed for the system and their specific roles.
### Details:
List out all required agent types (e.g., task planner, executor, evaluator) and describe their primary functions and responsibilities within the system.

## 2. Design agent communication protocols [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Establish protocols for inter-agent communication and data exchange.
### Details:
Define message formats, API endpoints, and data structures for agents to communicate effectively within the LangGraph framework.

## 3. Implement task planning agent [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Develop the agent responsible for breaking down complex tasks into manageable subtasks.
### Details:
Create a LangGraph-compatible agent that can analyze user inputs, generate subtasks, and assign them to appropriate executor agents.

## 4. Implement task execution agents [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Develop agents responsible for carrying out specific subtasks.
### Details:
Create multiple specialized agents capable of handling different types of subtasks, ensuring they can interact with external tools and APIs as needed.

## 5. Implement evaluation agent [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Develop an agent to assess the quality and completeness of executed tasks.
### Details:
Create an agent that can review outputs from executor agents, provide feedback, and determine if further actions are needed.

## 6. Design workflow management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Create a system to orchestrate the overall workflow of agents using LangGraph.
### Details:
Develop a central controller that manages agent interactions, task assignments, and overall process flow within the LangGraph framework.

## 7. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.6
### Description: Develop robust error handling and recovery processes for the agent system.
### Details:
Create mechanisms to detect and handle failures in agent operations, including retry logic, fallback options, and graceful degradation strategies.

## 8. Develop monitoring and logging system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.6
### Description: Implement a comprehensive monitoring and logging solution for the agent ecosystem.
### Details:
Create tools to track agent performance, log interactions and decisions, and provide real-time visibility into the system's operation.

## 9. Integrate external tools and APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Incorporate necessary external tools and APIs into the agent modules.
### Details:
Identify required external resources and implement integrations within relevant agent modules, ensuring proper authentication and data handling.

## 10. Conduct system testing and optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, 10.9
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the entire agent ecosystem and optimize performance.
### Details:
Design and execute test scenarios, identify bottlenecks, and refine agent interactions and workflow management for optimal system performance.
